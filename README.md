# Streaming platform

## Description
This project was made in my 2nd year from university.
I made a streaming platform, which given users, musics, artists, historics and albums, runs some diferent queries.
It also has a interactive and a test program.
The purpose of this project was developing concepts, such as encapsulation and modularity.
